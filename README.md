# Project-A.N.D-X
A project started way back, before Kali Linux, but was left "unfinished" due to some complications with the ideas, but now is brought back up in hopes that it will actually turn out usefull in the Pentesting field, Project includes: Wireless Hacking, Web site [fuzzing, crawling, SQL Exploitation, "dirb", etc], OS Fingerprinting, "Metasploit", Exploit developement, Exploits, Some custom Social Engineering Tactics, and  much more.

If any of you might be wondering why the project was left unfinished for that long, don't worry about it, just go through the source code when the first script is posted...Don't worry about how the script is setup or written (although suggestions might be great (if you are willing to tell me without laughing too much)), you will find everything to be self explanitory when everything is set and the program is finished (it might take a while, due to me being busy with other things)...Edit any time.

Disclaimer: FOR LINUX ONLY

# Chat integrated
The chat program is an integration to this program (framework) and the package will be included as .tar.gz (specifically: Chat.tar.gz) so it will complete this huge project.
