======[ FILE [DIRECTORY]: /root/andx/xcheck.py ]============================

Run the [ Python ] file "xcheck.py" in this exact directory: /root/andx
If you are running Linux Systems such as Ubuntu, Mint, create the "andx" directory in /root.

If you are running Kali Linux (or some other Pentesting Platform) then most of the dependencies are already installed. All that is left to do is to open a terminal [ with the home set to /root ] and run the command [ mkdir andx ] or if you already have the folder "andx" then don't worry about running the command. Then [ cd ] into the "andx" directory and run [ python xcheck.py ] and there you go

Dependencies [ Python ]:
========================
tqdm  -      pip install tqdm
requests  -  pip install requests
astral  -    pip install astral
pytz  -      [ Comes with astral (Astral) ]
